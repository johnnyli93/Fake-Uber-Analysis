# Pyber

In this assignment, we look over data on uber rides collected from 100+ imaginary cities. Included in the csv files are the rides recorded, timestamp, fare, unique and ride code.

With this data, we examine things like the percentage of fares/drivers between the different city types in pie charts and graph.
As expected, our expectations of uber in this fantasy world mirror the situation in real life. Rides and driver numbers are highests in urban areas. Average fare prices increase where drivers are scarce (high demand, low supply), which is usually in rural areas.
